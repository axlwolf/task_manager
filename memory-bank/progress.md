## Current Status
The application is in active development with the core functionality implemented. Users can view a list of users, select a user to see their tasks, add new tasks, and mark tasks as complete. The application follows Clean Architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns.

The UI is responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and modern user experience. State management is implemented using Angular Signals, providing reactive updates to the UI when data changes.

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt
1. **Error Handling**: Need to implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
2. **Form Validation**: Basic validation is in place, but needs enhancement
3. **Testing Coverage**: Currently lacks comprehensive test coverage
4. **Accessibility**: Need to ensure all components are fully accessible

### Bugs
1. **Task Creation**: Occasionally the task list doesn't update immediately after creating a new task
2. **User Selection**: Sometimes the selected user state doesn't persist through navigation
3. **Responsive Layout**: Minor layout issues on very small screens

### Performance Concerns
1. **Initial Load Time**: Could be optimized further
2. **Change Detection**: Need to ensure efficient change detection with signals
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for potential memory leaks with subscription management

## Next Milestone Goals
1. Complete task filtering and sorting functionality
2. Implement comprehensive error handling
3. Add loading indicators and improve UX
4. Begin writing unit tests for core functionality
5. Document the architecture and component usage
