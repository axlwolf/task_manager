## Current Status

The application is in active development with the core functionality implemented. Users can view a list of users, select a user to see their tasks, add new tasks, and mark tasks as complete. The application follows Clean Architecture principles with a clear separation of concerns.

The UI is responsive and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a clean and modern user experience. State management is implemented using Angular Signals, providing reactive updates to the UI when data changes.

Recent improvements include:

- Implementation of a complete dialog system with service-based API
- Integration of Phosphor Icons with microinteractions
- Enhanced theme system with improved contrast and harmonious colors
- Standardized component styling with CSS variables and theme classes
- Improved project structure with proper organization of shared components
- Implementation of Trunk-Based Development strategy with feature flags
- Creation of feature flag service for managing feature visibility

## Known Issues

### Technical Debt

1. **Error Handling**: Need to implement comprehensive error handling throughout the application
2. **Form Validation**: Basic validation is in place, but needs enhancement
3. **Testing Coverage**: Testing approach and strategies established, implementation needed for all levels (unit, integration, E2E)
4. **Accessibility**: Need to ensure all components are fully accessible

### Bugs

1. **Task Creation**: Occasionally the task list doesn't update immediately after creating a new task
2. **User Selection**: Sometimes the selected user state doesn't persist through navigation
3. **Responsive Layout**: Minor layout issues on very small screens

### Performance Concerns

1. **Initial Load Time**: Could be optimized further
2. **Change Detection**: Need to ensure efficient change detection with signals
3. **Memory Usage**: Monitor for potential memory leaks with subscription management

## Next Milestone Goals

1. Enhance task form component to use the dialog service
2. Implement task editing functionality using the dialog system
3. Implement task deletion functionality
4. Complete task filtering and sorting functionality with feature flags
5. Implement comprehensive error handling
6. Add loading indicators and improve UX
7. Expand test coverage using the established testing patterns
8. Implement unit tests for services, use cases, and repositories
9. Implement tests for feature flag functionality
10. Set up integration testing infrastructure and implement tests for key flows
11. Set up Cypress for E2E testing and implement tests for critical user journeys
12. Document the architecture and component usage
