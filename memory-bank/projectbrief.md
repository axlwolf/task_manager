# EasyTask - Project Brief

## Project Overview
EasyTask is a modern task management application built with Angular 18, designed to help teams manage their tasks efficiently. The application follows Clean Architecture principles to ensure maintainability, testability, and scalability.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Management**
   - Display a list of users
   - Select a user to view their tasks
   - User profiles with basic information

2. **Task Management**
   - Create new tasks with title, description, and due date
   - View tasks assigned to a specific user
   - Mark tasks as complete
   - Filter tasks by status (completed/pending)

3. **UI/UX**
   - Clean, modern interface
   - Responsive design for all device sizes
   - Intuitive navigation and task management
   - Visual indicators for task status and priority

### Technical Requirements
