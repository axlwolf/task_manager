3. **Testing**

   - Write unit tests for use cases
   - Create component tests
   - Implement end-to-end testing

4. **Documentation**

   - Complete inline code documentation
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Write developer guides

5. **Development Workflow Improvements**

   - Implement Feature Flags service for hiding incomplete features
   - Configure GitHub branch protection rules for the main branch
   - Set up GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration
   - Create pull request templates with checklists
   - Implement automated code quality checks

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **State Management Approach**

   - Using Angular Signals instead of NgRx for simpler state management
   - Considering performance implications for larger data sets

2. **Component Design**

   - Balancing component reusability vs. specificity
   - Deciding on presentation vs. container component patterns

3. **Data Fetching Strategy**

   - Currently using mock data
   - Planning for real API integration
   - Considering caching strategies

4. **Styling Approach**

   - Using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Maintaining consistent design language
   - Ensuring accessibility compliance

5. **Development Workflow**

   - Implementing Trunk-Based Development for faster integration
   - Considering team size and collaboration patterns
   - Evaluating the need for feature flags vs. feature branches
   - Planning CI/CD pipeline to support the workflow
   - Balancing frequent integration with stability
