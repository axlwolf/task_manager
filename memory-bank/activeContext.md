# EasyTask - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current development focus is on implementing the core functionality of the EasyTask application following Clean Architecture principles. This includes:

1. **User Interface Components**
   - Header with application logo
   - User list sidebar
   - Task list view
   - Task creation form
   - Task card component

2. **Core Functionality**
   - User selection
   - Task display by user
   - Task creation
   - Task completion

3. **Architecture Implementation**
   - Domain layer with models and repository interfaces
   - Application layer with use cases
   - Infrastructure layer with components, services, and repository implementations

## Recent Changes
1. **Project Structure**
   - Implemented Clean Architecture folder structure
   - Created domain, application, and infrastructure layers
   - Set up proper dependency injection

2. **UI Components**
   - Created logo and branding
   - Implemented responsive layout
   - Developed user list and task components

3. **State Management**
   - Implemented state management with Angular Signals
   - Created TasksStoreService for centralized state
   - Set up proper reactivity patterns

4. **Data Flow**
   - Implemented repository pattern
   - Created use cases for business logic
   - Set up mock data for development

## Next Steps
1. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add loading indicators
   - Implement error handling
   - Add animations for smoother transitions

2. **Expand Functionality**
   - Implement task filtering
   - Add task prioritization
   - Enable task editing

3. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for use cases
   - Create component tests
   - Implement end-to-end testing

4. **Documentation**
   - Complete inline code documentation
   - Create architecture diagrams
   - Write developer guides

## Active Decisions and Considerations
1. **State Management Approach**
   - Using Angular Signals instead of NgRx for simpler state management
   - Considering performance implications for larger data sets

2. **Component Design**
   - Balancing component reusability vs. specificity
   - Deciding on presentation vs. container component patterns

3. **Data Fetching Strategy**
   - Currently using mock data
   - Planning for real API integration
   - Considering caching strategies

4. **Styling Approach**
   - Using Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
   - Maintaining consistent design language
   - Ensuring accessibility compliance
